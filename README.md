LookupForm
===========================

A Simple C# lookup form. Very short and simple code yet nice look and usability. You can simultaneously type and use arrows to move selection, no focus switching needed! A nice thing to embed in your own app. Just [download](https://github.com/poma/LookupForm/downloads) example.exe and see how it behaves.
